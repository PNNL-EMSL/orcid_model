# orcid_model

This repository contains a sample model representing a proposal object that could be pushed to a users ORCID record
via the [v3.0 api](https://members.orcid.org/api/workflow#3.0). Included is a sample (OrcidJsonDocTest.java) that gives a simple example of how this model 
could be populated and generates a valid Json document for pushing to ORCID. This sample API is based off work that ORCID did to release a [standalone xml to json converter](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/orcid-api-users/U8YyD-Nn4rs).

We have made a couple of videos demonstrating how we are using this API at the EMSL facility
